## 🔧 Technical Decisions Log

### [2025-09-17] Database Architecture Decision
**Decision:** Use dual database architecture (PostgreSQL + Vector DB)  
**Rationale:** 
- PostgreSQL with PostGIS for spatial/temporal queries on structured ARGO data
- FAISS/ChromaDB for semantic search and RAG pipeline
- Enables both traditional SQL queries and AI-powered natural language search
**Alternatives Considered:** Single database with vector extensions
**Impact:** Increased complexity but better performance for AI features

### [2025-09-17] LLM Provider Selection
**Decision:** Google Gemini Studio API as primary LLM  
**Rationale:**
- Free tier with generous quotas for development/demo
- Strong multilingual support (Hindi/English)
- Good performance for conversational AI tasks
**Alternatives Considered:** OpenAI GPT, local models (Ollama)
**Impact:** Dependency on Google services but cost-effective for hackathon

### [2025-09-17] Voice Processing Strategy
**Decision:** Hybrid approach with Web Speech API + server-side fallback  
**Rationale:**
- Web Speech API for real-time browser-based recognition
- Python SpeechRecognition for server-side processing when needed
- gTTS for text-to-speech synthesis
**Alternatives Considered:** Fully client-side or server-side only
**Impact:** Better reliability and user experience across devices

## 🔮 Future Planning

### Next Sprint Planning
**Sprint 2: Data Foundation (September 18-22, 2025)**
- Set up development environment with all required tools
- Implement ARGO data ingestion using Argopy library
- Design and create PostgreSQL database schema
- Build basic ETL pipeline for NetCDF to database conversion
- Create vector database setup for metadata embeddings

### Risk Monitoring
1. **Technical Risks:** API quotas, performance bottlenecks, voice accuracy
2. **Timeline Risks:** Complexity underestimation, integration challenges
3. **Resource Risks:** Free tier limitations, hosting constraints

### Continuous Improvement
- **Code Quality:** Implement automated quality checks from day one
- **Testing Strategy:** Build comprehensive test suite alongside development
- **Documentation:** Maintain up-to-date documentation throughout development

## 📝 Notes and Reminders

### Development Notes
- Remember to implement graceful degradation for all external API dependencies
- Voice processing should have text fallback for accessibility
- All database queries must be optimized for large datasets from the start
- Implement comprehensive error handling and user feedback throughout

### Reminder Checklist
- [ ] Set up automated backups before adding production data
- [ ] Implement rate limiting before public deployment
- [ ] Test voice features across different browsers and devices
- [ ] Validate multilingual support with native speakers
- [ ] Create comprehensive API documentation with examples
